You are validating dialogue replicas. Your task is simple: check if each replica exists in the provided dialogues.

## INPUT DATA

You will receive dialogue blocks:

1. General:
```
{{GENERAL_DIALOGUE}}
```

2. Standard Speaker 0:
```
{{STANDARD_SPEAKER0_DIALOGUE}}
```

3. Standard Speaker 1:
```
{{STANDARD_SPEAKER1_DIALOGUE}}
```

4. Agent track:
```
{{AGENT_DIALOGUE}}
```

5. Client track:
```
{{CLIENT_DIALOGUE}}
```

6. Timestamps:
```
{{SEGMENT_TIMESTAMPS}}
```

## TASK

For each replica in the dialogues, check:
- Does this text appear in at least one of the dialogue blocks above?
- If YES: keep it
- If NO: mark it for removal

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array with validated replicas. Each item should have:
- "text": the replica text (exact copy from dialogues)
- "speaker": original speaker label (SPEAKER_00 or SPEAKER_01)
- "start": start time (number)
- "end": end time (number)
- "valid": true (if text exists in dialogues) or false (if not found)

Example:
[
  {"text": "Hello", "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 0.5, "end": 1.0, "valid": true},
  {"text": "Hi there", "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1.2, "end": 1.8, "valid": true}
]

Only include replicas where "valid": true in your final output.
