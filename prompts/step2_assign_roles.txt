You are assigning roles (Agent or Client) to speakers. Your task is simple: use the role guidance to decide who is Agent and who is Client.

## INPUT DATA

1. Validated replicas (from previous step):
```
{{VALIDATED_REPLICAS}}
```

2. Role guidance:
```
{{ROLE_GUIDANCE}}
```

## TASK

For each replica:
- Read the ROLE_GUIDANCE to see who is Agent and who is Client
- If ROLE_GUIDANCE says "SPEAKER_00 is Agent", then all SPEAKER_00 replicas become "Agent"
- If ROLE_GUIDANCE says "SPEAKER_01 is Client", then all SPEAKER_01 replicas become "Client"
- Assign the role based on the speaker label and ROLE_GUIDANCE

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array. Each item should have:
- "text": the replica text
- "speaker": "Agent" or "Client" (based on ROLE_GUIDANCE)
- "start": start time (number)
- "end": end time (number)

Example:
[
  {"text": "Hello", "speaker": "Agent", "start": 0.5, "end": 1.0},
  {"text": "Hi there", "speaker": "Client", "start": 1.2, "end": 1.8}
]
