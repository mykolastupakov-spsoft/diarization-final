You are formatting the final table. Your task is simple: convert the cleaned replicas into a Markdown table.

## INPUT DATA

Cleaned replicas (from previous step):
```
{{CLEANED_REPLICAS}}
```

## TASK

1. Sort replicas by start time (earliest first)
2. Create a Markdown table with columns: Segment ID, Speaker, Text, Start Time, End Time
3. Segment ID starts at 1 and counts up (1, 2, 3, 4...)
4. Speaker is "Agent" or "Client"
5. Text is exact copy (no changes)
6. Start Time and End Time are numbers (like 0.50 or 1.23)

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY the Markdown table (no other text):

| Segment ID | Speaker | Text | Start Time | End Time |
|------------|---------|------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Agent | [text] | [number] | [number] |
| 2 | Client | [text] | [number] | [number] |
