You are analyzing audio transcription diarization results from Speechmatics to find phrases that were correctly recognized.

**CONTEXT:**
- **general**: Transcription of the ENTIRE audio file with BOTH voices. Speechmatics analyzed the full audio and created segments with speaker labels (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01). Access segments via `general.speechmatics.segments` or `general.segments`.
- **speaker1**: Individual track with ONLY speaker 1's isolated voice. Access segments via `speaker1.speechmatics.segments` or `speaker1.segments`.
- **speaker2**: Individual track with ONLY speaker 2's isolated voice. Access segments via `speaker2.speechmatics.segments` or `speaker2.segments`.

**YOUR TASK:**
Find ALL segments from `general` that have matching text in `speaker1` OR `speaker2` tracks.

For each segment in `general.segments` (or `general.speechmatics.segments`):
1. Extract the text and normalize it (lowercase, remove punctuation, normalize spaces)
2. Search for similar text in ALL segments from `speaker1.segments` (or `speaker1.speechmatics.segments`)
3. Search for similar text in ALL segments from `speaker2.segments` (or `speaker2.speechmatics.segments`)
4. If you find a match (similarity >= 80%) in at least one speaker track, include this general segment in the result

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Do NOT wrap it in an object. Do NOT use "output" field. Return the array directly.

Each item must have exactly these fields:
- `text`: The text from the general segment (string)
- `start`: Start time in seconds from the general segment (number)
- `end`: End time in seconds from the general segment (number)

Example output (copy this format exactly):
[
  {"text": "Are you available for a short conversation right now", "start": 5.68, "end": 8.24},
  {"text": "Thank you", "start": 15.2, "end": 16.1}
]

If no matching phrases are found, return: []

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Return ONLY the JSON array, nothing else. No "output" field, no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks.
2. Iterate through ALL segments in `general.segments` or `general.speechmatics.segments`
3. For each general segment, check if its text exists (similarity >= 80%) in speaker1 or speaker2 segments
4. Use the exact `start` and `end` values from the general segment
5. Include segments with at least 3 words
6. Sort by start time (ascending)

**HOW TO COMPARE TEXT:**
1. Normalize both texts: convert to lowercase, remove all punctuation, normalize spaces to single spaces
2. Compare normalized texts word by word
3. If >= 80% of words match, consider it a match
4. Also check if one text contains the other (for partial matches)

**Input data structure:**
The input will have this structure:
{
  "general": {
    "speechmatics": { "segments": [...] },
    "segments": [...]
  },
  "speaker1": {
    "speechmatics": { "segments": [...] },
    "segments": [...]
  },
  "speaker2": {
    "speechmatics": { "segments": [...] },
    "segments": [...]
  }
}

**Input data:**
{{ $json.body }}
