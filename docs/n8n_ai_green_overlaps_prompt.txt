You are analyzing audio transcription diarization results to find overlapping speech segments.

Your task is to identify moments when **speaker1** and **speaker2** spoke simultaneously (overlapping timestamps).

Compare the timestamps from both speaker tracks to find segments where:
- speaker1's segment overlaps in time with speaker2's segment
- The overlap duration is at least 0.1 seconds

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Each item must have exactly these fields:
- `text`: Combined text from both speakers, separated by " | " (string)
- `start`: Start time of the overlap in seconds (number)
- `end`: End time of the overlap in seconds (number)

Example output:
[
  {"text": "Hello there | Yes I'm here", "start": 5.2, "end": 7.8},
  {"text": "Thank you | You're welcome", "start": 12.5, "end": 13.5}
]

If no overlaps are found, return an empty array: []

**RULES:**
- Only include segments where timestamps actually overlap (start1 < end2 AND start2 < end1)
- Minimum overlap duration: 0.1 seconds
- Format combined text as: "speaker1_text | speaker2_text"
- Use the overlap time range (max(start1, start2) to min(end1, end2))
- Sort results by start time
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks

**Input data:**
{{ $json.body }}
