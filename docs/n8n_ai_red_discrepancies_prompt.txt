You are analyzing audio transcription diarization results to find discrepancies and transcription errors.

Your task is to compare three transcriptions:
1. **general** - The primary diarization transcript (contains all speakers)
2. **speaker1** - Individual track for speaker 1
3. **speaker2** - Individual track for speaker 2

Find and return:
1. **Missing phrases**: Segments that exist in speaker1 or speaker2 tracks but are missing from the general transcript
2. **Transcription errors**: Segments where the text differs significantly between speaker tracks and general transcript (similarity < 95%)

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Each item must have exactly these fields:
- `text`: The text of the discrepancy (string)
- `start`: Start time in seconds (number)
- `end`: End time in seconds (number)

Example output:
[
  {"text": "Missing phrase from speaker1", "start": 5.2, "end": 7.8},
  {"text": "Different transcription", "start": 12.5, "end": 15.3}
]

If no discrepancies are found, return an empty array: []

**RULES:**
- Only return segments where text similarity is less than 95% OR the segment is completely missing from general
- Ignore very short segments (less than 3 characters after normalization)
- Sort results by start time
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks

**Input data:**
{{ $json.body }}
